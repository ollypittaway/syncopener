## Features

- **Automatic File Detection:** Opens related files based on the configurations specified in the `.syncopener` file.
- **Support for Multiple Extensions:** Works with a variety of file extensions including `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.html`, `.css`, and `.scss`.
- **Workspace Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your Visual Studio Code workspace, supporting projects with multiple directories.


## Getting Started

### Installation

To install SyncOpener, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "SyncOpener".
4. Click on the install button next to the extension.


## Configuration

To configure SyncOpener, you need to create a `.syncopener` file in the root of your workspace. This JSON-formatted file specifies pairs of directories to sync and optional specific extensions for the files within those directories.

#### `.syncopener` File Format

The `.syncopener` file should contain an array of objects, each representing a pair of directories. Hereâ€™s the format you should follow:

```json
[
    {
        "directory1": {
            "path": "/path/to/first/directory",
            "extension": ".js"
        },
        "directory2": {
            "path": "/path/to/second/directory",
            "extension": ".ts"
        }
    },
    {
        "directory1": {
            "path": "/path/to/third/directory"
        },
        "directory2": {
            "path": "/path/to/fourth/directory"
        }
    }
]
```


- **path:**
The relative path from the root of the workspace to the directory.

- **extension (optional):** 
If specified, the extension transformation will apply when switching between files in these directories. This is useful when working on Front-End styling. For example: link the initial directory with ".jsx" extension and the second directory as ".scss" and it will open the files simulatenously. **Files must be called the same other than the extension.**


## Examples

For files with the same extension the `extension` can be omitted. This can be seen here:

</p>


For files with different extensions (e.g .jsx and .scss) define the `extension` for both files in the JSON like below:

<p align="center">
	<img src="previews/DifferentExtension.gif">
</p>


## Usage

Once SyncOpener is installed and configured, simply open a file that matches the criteria in your `.syncopener` configuration. SyncOpener will automatically detect and open the corresponding file in the paired directory, allowing you to work across files seamlessly.
